# v9.0.0 Migration guide

This guide assumes you have an existing app running on `sku v8`. If you are still on a version of sku prior to v8, please checkout the [v8 Migration guide](./migration-guides/v8.0.0) as well.

> If you have any issues or concerns updating to sku v9, please post in the #sku-support slack channel.

**Obligatory warning to check everything still works**

We try to validate sku works across a big variety of scenarios before releasing. However, as with all major sku releases, please validate that your app continues to work as expected in a real environment as well as locally.

## Dynamic imports using `loadable`

Previously, to use dynamic components in your app you would import the namespaced version of `loadable` provided by `sku`. This is no longer the case, while we still use, support & provide loadable components, the import is no longer scoped to `sku`, eg:

```diff
-import loadable from 'sku/@loadable/component';
+import loadable from '@loadable/component';
```

## Braid consumers

If you are consuming the `braid-design-system`, you will need to ensure that you are on the latest version (>= `v0.0.63`) as it depends on this release.
