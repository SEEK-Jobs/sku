# v9.0.0 Migration guide

This guide assumes you have an existing app running on `sku v8`. If you are still on a version of sku prior to v8, please checkout the [v8 Migration guide](./migration-guides/v8.0.0) as well.

> If you have any issues or concerns updating to sku v9, please post in the #sku-support slack channel.

**Obligatory warning to check everything still works**

We try to validate sku works across a big variety of scenarios before releasing. However, as with all major sku releases, please validate that your app continues to work as expected in a real environment as well as locally.
