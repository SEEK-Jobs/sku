# v9.0.0 Migration guide

This guide assumes you have an existing app running on `sku v8`. If you are still on a version of sku prior to v8, you should first follow the [v8 Migration guide](./migration-guides/v8.0.0).

> If you have any issues or concerns updating to sku v9, please post in the #sku-support slack channel.

**Obligatory warning to check everything still works**

We try to validate sku works across a big variety of scenarios before releasing. However, as with all major sku releases, please validate that your app continues to work as expected in a real environment as well as locally.

## Dynamic imports using `@loadable`

If your application features code splitting, you will need to update your [Loadable Components](https://github.com/smooth-code/loadable-components) imports to remove the `sku/` prefix. For example:

```diff
-import loadable from 'sku/@loadable/component';
+import loadable from '@loadable/component';
```

## Braid Design System consumers

If you are consuming `braid-design-system`, you will need to ensure that you are on v0.0.63 or newer as it depends on this release.
