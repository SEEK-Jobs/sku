# v9.0.0 Migration guide

This guide assumes you have an existing app running on `sku v8`. If you are still on a version of sku prior to v8, please checkout the [v8 Migration guide](./migration-guides/v8.0.0) as well.

> If you have any issues or concerns updating to sku v9, please post in the #sku-support slack channel.

**Obligatory warning to check everything still works**

We try to validate sku works across a big variety of scenarios before releasing. However, as with all major sku releases, please validate that your app continues to work as expected in a real environment as well as locally.

## Removal of TSLint in favour of ESLint

We have migrated the linting of TypeScript files from `TSLint` to `ESLint`. As a result the `tslint.json` config file is no longer needed. The `configure` script (which runs postinstall) should clean up this file automatically and remove it from your `.gitignore`, however please ensure:

- The `tslint.json` config file is removed from your project
- Commit your updated `.gitignore` file with the `tslint.json` entry removed

## Major `eslint-config-seek` upgrade

Our core eslint rules package `eslint-config-seek` has received a [major upgrade](https://github.com/seek-oss/eslint-config-seek/releases/tag/v5.0.0). You may receive lint errors that were not present previously in your project. Major things to look out for are:

- Updated React rules to suit common practices
- Removal of some more restrictive rules
- Moved jest specific rules to only target test files (e.g. `thing.test.js`, `other.spec.ts`)
- Moved cypress specific rules to only target files within a top-level `cypress` folder
